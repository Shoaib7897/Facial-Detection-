# Facial-Detection using OpenCV
In this project, the individual face is recognized by the camera (it needs to be stored in the database with the respective name and ID to be identified), attendance of the person will be added with the name and ID to a CSV file (not containing duplicates). If the face is not recognized, there are no changes made in the CSV file, and the face is detected as unknown. The project consists of three files namely face_dataset.py, face_training.py, and face_ recognition.py.

OpenCV:
 OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
